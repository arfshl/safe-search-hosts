# safesearch-enforcing-hosts
This script fetches the latest list of google domains and generates a hosts file
that can be used to force safe search for your entire computer, or router.

Enhancing: Add Bing,Ecosia, and Yandex hosts

Note: I personally recommend to use custom DNS server to force safesearch since it doesn't change your system, and supports more search engine that require CNAME based enforcing like DuckDuckGo [Looks Here](https://github.com/arfshl/adblock-dns-config/blob/main/docs/parental-resolver.md)
